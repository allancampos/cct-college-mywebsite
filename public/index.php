Although there is great engineering, expertise and knowledge, great architecture carefully mapped-out and state-of-the-art infrastructure,no one can truly guarantee 100% Uptime.

Backup and recovery describes the process of creating and storing copies of data that can be used to protect organizations against data loss. This is sometimes referred to as operational recovery. Recovery from a backup typically involves restoring the data to the original location, or to an alternate location where it can be used in place of the lost or damaged data.')"> Researched</button>
